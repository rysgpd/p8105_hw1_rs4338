# Problem 0.1:

- Create a public GitHub repo + local R Project (p8105_hw1_rs4338)
- Create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw1_rs4338.rmd that renders to
  github_document
- Submit a link to your repo via Courseworks:
  (<https://github.com/rysgpd/p8105_hw1_rs4338>)

# Problem 1:

### We load and describe the Palmer `penguins` dataset

- Names/Variables:
  - Species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
  - Island (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)
  - Bill Length (in mm)
  - Bill Depth (in mm)
  - Flipper Length (in mm)
  - Body Mass (in g)
  - Sex (Female, Male)
    - 11 missing data
  - Year (2007, 2008, 2009)
- Size of the dataset: 344 rows, 8 columns/variables
- Mean Flipper Length: 200.9152 mm
- There are 2 penguins with missing data about their body, bill, and
  flipper measurements.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

summary(penguins)
```

``` r
# code to find the number of rows and columns
col_num = ncol(penguins)
row_num = nrow(penguins)

# code to find the mean flipper length
mean_flipper_length = 
  penguins %>%
    pull(flipper_length_mm) %>%
    mean(na.rm=TRUE)
```

### Then, we show a scatterplot of the `flipper_length_mm` (y) vs `bill_length_mm` (x) variable.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color = species), na.rm=TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Penguin Bill Length vs. Flipper Length") +
  xlab("Bill Length (mm)") +
  ylab("Flipper Width (mm)") +
  labs(col="Species")
```

``` r
# export the scatterplot 
ggsave("penguins_scatterplot.png")
```

# Problem 2:

#### Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  norm_sample = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = norm_sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("single", "married", "married", "single", "divorced", "single", "married", "single", "divorced", "single"))
)
```

### Attempting to take the mean of each variable in my dataframe:

It is possible to take the mean of vectors that consist of numeric or
logical values (ex: the random sample of 10 from a standard Normal
distribution and the logical vector that showed whether the random
sample of 10 elements were greater than 0). The logical values can be
seen as 0 and 1 for false and true respectively. However, character
vectors and factor vectors cannot be used to calculate a “mean”.

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, norm_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.4440585

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Let’s try converting the logical, character, factor vectors to numeric and see if we can take the mean then:

The logic and factor vectors were able to be converted to numeric
vectors. For the logic vector, it converted false to 0 and true to 1.
For the factor vector, it took the three factors and assigned them
values of 1-3, by alphabetical order (divorced: 1, married: 2, single:
3). You can also specify what each of the factors should equate to if
you don’t want it in alphabetical order. However, it was unable to
convert the character vector to numeric, so the mean still could not be
calculated then.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
mean(as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical)))

as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
mean(as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_char)))

as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
mean(as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor)))
```

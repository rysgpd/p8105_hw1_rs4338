[Homework Assignment Details](https://p8105.com/homework_1.html)

Problem 0.1:

* Create a public GitHub repo + local R Project (p8105_hw1_rs4338)
* Create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw1_rs4338.rmd that renders to github_document
* Submit a link to your repo via Courseworks: (https://github.com/rysgpd/p8105_hw1_rs4338)

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The purpose of this file is to present a couple of basic plots using `ggplot`.

First we create a dataframe containing variables for our plots.

```{r df_create}
set.seed(1234)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
```

First we show a histogram of the `x` variable.

```{r x_hist}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

Next we show a scatterplot of `y` vs `x`. 

```{r yx_scatter}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```
